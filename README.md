# Chessboard

A Chessboard built using Vanilla JS.

## Demo (Work In Progress)

Here is the current demo of what it looks like. So far I have successfully created the board, and given them the correct pieces in the correct positions. When you click on a chess piece, the Element Node is grabbed as well as gets the piece, as well as the current piece's position (row, column);

T0DO:
 - 1. Highlight where current selected piece can move to.
 - 2. Check if piece can take a piece from an opponent.
 - 3. Score tracker and Scoreboard.
 - 4. Checkmate!
